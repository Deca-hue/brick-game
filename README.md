## 📂 Project Structure

## 🧠 How It Works

- Bricks are arranged in rows and columns.
- Ball moves every frame using `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Ball bounces off walls, paddle, and bricks.
- When the ball hits a brick:
  - Brick disappears.
  - Score increases.
- When all bricks are cleared: **YOU WIN!**
- If ball touches bottom edge: **GAME OVER.**
